# Chip8.JS

Javascript implementation of the Chip 8 Virtual Machine

This is a personal project to learn the basics of writing an emulator. Initially I wanted to write the MIX computer but decided to settle with Chip 8 due to simplicity.. I figure I would have more fun writing an emulator for a computer that is used for game programming in the 1970s.

Current Status: Work in progress ( 80% done )

The emulator can run most of the Chip 8 program and some games. There are still some work to do to make it fully functional.

Features not fully implemented yet:
1. Virtual keyboard ( The keyboard works, but is not fully tested ) 
2. Sound 
3. 100% compatibility with all Chip 8 program.

How to run the emulator:
1. Open the index.html using your internet browser ( eg. Chrome )
2. Open the chip8 program by choosing a file. ( eg. Select ..Chip-8 Pack\Chip-8 Demos\maze.ch8 )
3. Voila!
